# lyrics-sentiment-analysis
In this project, I worked on analyzing the sentiment of lyrics from 10 different artists' 10 most popular
songs. 

Essentially, I did this in three steps: data collection of song lyrics using the Genius API and BeautifulSoup for scraping the lyrics from the HTML, analyzing the lexical diversity of the lyrics using word clouds and matplotlib and generating and sentiment analysis.
