Ah, ah, ah
Ah...
I'm the boy in your other phone
Lighting up inside your drawer at home, all alone
Pushing 40 in the friend zone
We talk and then you walk away, every day
Oh, you don't think twice 'bout me
And maybe you're right to doubt me, but
But if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Oh, I want a take two, I want to break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light
Take a ride up to Malibu
I just wanna sit and look at you, look at you
What would it matter if your friends knew?
Who cares what other people say, anyway
Oh, we can go far from here
And make a new world together, babe
'Cause if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Oh, I want a take two, I want to break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...
Yeah, if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's runnin' through my veins for you?
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's runnin' through my veins for you?
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's runnin' through my veins for you?
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Ooh, yeah
How much of my mother has my mother left in me?
How much of my love will be insane to some degree?
And what about this feeling that I'm never good enough?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?
How much of my father am I destined to become?
Will I dim the lights inside me just to satisfy someone?
Will I let this woman kill me, or do away with jealous love?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?
I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?
How much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be?
Does a broken home become another broken family?
Or will we be there for each other like nobody ever could?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?
I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?
I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?
It's not a silly little moment
It's not the storm before the calm
This is the deep and dying breath of
This love that we've been working on
Can't seem to hold you like I want to
So I can feel you in my arms
Nobody's going to come and save you
We pulled too many false alarms
We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
I was the one you always dreamed of
You were the one I tried to draw
How dare you say it's nothing to me?
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
I'll make the most of all the sadness
You'll be a bitch, because you can
You try to hit me, just to hurt me
So you leave me feeling dirty
'Cause you can't understand
We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
Go cry about it, why don't you?
Go cry about it, why don't you?
Go cry about it, why don't you?
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
Burning room
Burning room
Burning room
Burning room
Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
Moving on and getting over
Are not the same, it seems to me
'Cause you've been gone, I'm growing older
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time
Moving on and getting over
Are not the friends they used to be
It's been so long since I got to hold you
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time, all the time
Tell me I can have the fact you've loved me to hold onto
Tell me I can keep the door cracked open, to let light through
For all my running, I can understand
I'm one text away from being back again
But I'm moving on and I'm getting over
I'm getting over, I'm getting over
I got to get over
Moving on and getting over
It's been so long; it just goes to show you
That I still can't seem to get you off my mind 
And I sure would like to see you one more time
It's taken me so long just to say "so long"
And baby it's so wrong, but I'm moving on
I'm gonna get a new girl
A something-I-can-do-girl
To try to get me through, girl
'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
Consider me as good as gone
'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Moving on, baby
Moving on
Moving on
Only a nascent trying to harness huge fire
Out on the beach in the darkness starting bonfire
So gorgeous, a man might cry
Burning trees in the basement start a cool fire
Feel my heartbeat racing, baby you're on fire
So gorgeous, a man might cry
Back in Paris you told me you were suicidal
It's not a vacation if I lose you to the Eiffel
You're gorgeous but you can't fly
A hidden admirer sent me roses white as fire
We took our handfuls it was war, flower fighter
Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire
Rosie
Come down and get the door for me
I'm drunk again, remember when we used to be?
Rosie
I know you said no more for me
But that was all before this dream that just came to me
Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune
Rosie
You don't have to hide his things
I'm fine with all the sorrow that tomorrow brings
Whoa-oh-oh, Rosie
Don't you know my love is true
'Perdon' and 'lo siento', see, I learned those words for you
Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune
Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune
I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me
Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made
Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Boys, you can break
You find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart
On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the God and the weight of her world
On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the God and the weight of her world
Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
So mothers be good to your daughters, too
So mothers be good to your daughters, too
I still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
I still feel
I still feel
I still feel like your man
The prettiest girl in the room she wants me
I know because she told me so
She says come over
I'd like to get to know you
But I just don't think I can
'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
I still keep your shampoo in my shower
In case you wanna wash your hair
And I know that you probably found yourself some more somewhere
But I do not really care
'Cause as long as it is there
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man, oh mama
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man, your man
Still like the letters in your name and how they feel, babe
Still think I'm never gonna find another you
Still like to leave the party early and go home, babe
And don't you know, babe
I'd rather sit here on my own and be alone, beâ€”
'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
 Still feel like your man 
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man 
Still feel like your man
I still feel like
I still feel like
I still feel like
I still, I still
Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down
Oh, I'll never know
What makes this man, with all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away
Woah, woah
Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down
Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees
Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees
Woah, woah
Gravity, stay the hell away from me
Woah, woah
Gravity has taken better men than me
Now, how can that be?
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where, now, keep me where the light is
Oh honey
You don't have to try so hard
To hurt me
Don't worry
I been thinking bout you too
What do we do
Your heart is where my head should be
The dissonance is killing me
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
I just hold on
Oh honey
I been talking to myself
Just to hear you
And you're saying
Everything I wish you would
And it's so good
It's raining on the mission bell
They're draining out the wishing well
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
I just hold on
I rose in you like morning light
And sheltered you asleep at night
It breaks my heart
It takes all the love I have to say
I know we're gonna be ok
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
Until it's gone
