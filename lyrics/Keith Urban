[Verse 1]
I can...
See you over there starin' at your drink
Watchin' that ice sink, all alone tonight
And...
Chances are you're sittin' here in this bar
'Cause he ain't gonna treat you right
Well, it's...
Probably not my place but I'm gonna say it anyway
‘Cause you look like
You...
Haven’t felt the fire, had a little fun
Hadn’t had a smile in a little while, baby

[Chorus]
Blue...
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall
But darlin', it don’t match your eyes
I’m tellin’ you...
You don’t need that guy
It’s so black and white, he’s stealin’ your thunder
Baby, blue ain’t your color

[Verse 2]
I'm not tryna...
Be another just pick you up kinda guy
Tryna drink you up, tryna take you home
But I just...
I don't understand how another man
Can take your sun and turn it ice cold
Well, I've...
Had enough to drink and it's makin' me think
That I just might
Tell you...
If I were a painter I wouldn’t change ya
I’d just paint you bright, baby

[Chorus]
'Cause blue...
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall
But darlin', it don’t match your eyes
I’m tellin’ you...
You don’t need that guy
It’s so black and white, he’s stealin’ your thunder
Baby, blue ain’t your color

[Bridge]
No, no, no
Mmmm
It ain't your color baby
Mmm, baby

[Chorus]
Blue...
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall
But darlin', it don’t match your eyes
I’m tellin’ you...
You don’t need that guy
It’s so black and white, he’s stealin’ your thunder
Baby, blue ain’t your color
Blue ain’t your color

[Outro]
Mmm, no, no, no baby
Come here, baby
Let me light up your world



[Verse 1]
When you hear somebody say somebody hits like a girl
How does that hit you?
Is that such a bad thing?
When you hear a song that they play sayin' you run the world
Do you believe it?
Will you live to see it?

[Chorus]
Sister, shoulder
Daughter, lover
Healer, broken halo
Mother nature
Fire, suit of armor
Sole survivor, Holy Water
Secret keeper, fortune teller
Virgin Mary, scarlet letter
Technicolor, river wild
Baby, girl, woman, child
Female

[Verse 2]
When somebody laughs and implies that she asked for it
Just cause she was wearing a skirt
Oh, is that how that works?
When somebody talks about how it was Adam first
Does that make you second best?
Or did he save the best for last?

[Chorus]
Sister, shoulder
Daughter, lover
Healer, broken halo
Mother nature
Fire, suit of armor
Sole survivor, Holy Water
Secret keeper, fortune teller
Virgin Mary, scarlet letter
Technicolor, river wild
Baby, girl, woman, child
Female

[Refrain]
Yeah
Female

[Bridge]
She's the heart of life
She's the dreamer's dream
She's the hands of time
She's the queen of kings

[Chorus]
Sister, shoulder
Daughter, lover
Healer, broken halo
Mother nature
Fire, suit of armor
Sole survivor, Holy Water
Secret keeper, fortune teller
Virgin Mary, scarlet letter
Technicolor, river wild
Baby, girl, woman, child
Female

[Outro]
Mhm
Female



[Verse 1]
I'm a 45 spinning on an old Victrola
I'm a two-strike swinger, I'm a Pepsi Cola
I'm a blue jean quarterback saying "I love you" to the prom queen
In a Chevy
I'm John Wayne, Superman, California
I'm a Kris Kristofferson, Sunday morning
I'm a mama and daddy singing along to Don McLean
At the levee

[Chorus]
And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, hey
Everything I needed
That's right

[Verse 2]
I'm Mark Twain on the Mississippi
I'm Hemingway with a shot of whiskey
I'm a TV dinner on a tray trying to figure out the Wheel of Fortune
I'm a Texaco star, I'm a Gibson guitar
I'm still a teenage kid trying to go too far
I'm a jukebox waiting in a neon bar for a quarter

[Chorus]
And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16

[Bridge]
I spent a lot of years running from believing
Looking for another way to save my soul
The longer I live, the more I see it
There's only one way home

[Chorus]
And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16
Oh, I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old (never grow old)
Another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16

[Outro]
(John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16)
Everything I needed
(John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16)
Everything I needed
(John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16)
Oh, that's right



[Verse 1: Keith Urban]
I know he hurt you
Made you scared of love, too scared to love
He didn't deserve you
'Cause your precious heart is a precious heart
He didn't know what he had and I thank God, oh, oh, oh
And it's gonna take just a little time
But you're gonna see that I was born to love you

[Chorus: Keith Urban & Carrie Underwood]
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter

[Verse 2: Keith Urban]
Look in the mirror
You're beautiful, so beautiful
I'm here to remind you
You're my only one, let me be the one
To heal all the pain that he put you through
It's a love like you never knew
Just let me show you

[Chorus: Keith Urban & Carrie Underwood]
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise, I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter

[Bridge: Keith Urban & Carrie Underwood]
I wanna believe that you got me, baby
I swear I do from now until the next life
I wanna love, wanna give you all my heart

[Chorus: Keith Urban & Carrie Underwood]
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter

[Outro: Keith Urban & Carrie Underwood]
What if I fall?
What if I cry?
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter



[Verse 1]
You said "I love you" to me
And I don't know what that means
So I froze on my feet
People use it so carelessly
And I couldn’t believe
That you would dive in so deep
And you said perfectly
Everything I’ve been feelin' about you
It’s time to break the chains that held me back from you

[Chorus]
So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line

[Verse 2]
Well I was never the type
To put it all on the line
But I've been changing my mind since you opened my eyes
It was the way that the light
Picked you out of that night
Then you were right by my side
Put a soul in my body
And now it’s time to close the space between the two of us

[Chorus]
So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line

[Bridge]
Oh, baby it's time
Oh, it's time

[Chorus]
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now

[Outro]
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line
And put our hearts in a parallel line
And put our hearts in a parallel line



[Verse 1]
There'll be days your heart don't wanna beat
You pray more than you breathe
And you just wanna fall to pieces
And nights, those 2 AM calls
Where dreams become walls
And you just need a break
Break on me

[Chorus]
Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me

[Verse 2]
There'll be times when someone you know
Becomes someone you knew
But you'd do anything to change it
And words you wanna take back
But you know you can't
When the page just won't turn
And it still hurts
Break on me

[Chorus]
Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me
(Ooo oo aah aah, ooo oo aaah aah ooo ooo aaah aaah)

[Bridge]
Oh, when you need somebody
When you need somebody right now
You're where I'll be
Break on me

[Chorus]
Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me
Break on me
Break on me, baby
Hmmmm



[Verse 1: Keith Urban]
I wake up feeling, in my soul I'm
Living someone else's life
I'm turnin' into concrete, harder than these city streets
Where no one even cares if I'm alive

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban]
I gotta get it right, mmm
Get it right, mmm mmm

[Chorus: Keith Urban]
There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home, home, home, mmm
Coming home

[Verse 2: Keith Urban]
My mind's heavy and I can't sleep, not even a memory
Is good enough to get me through the night, mmm
I'm longin' for the real thing, people who know the real me
And all the ways to love me back to life

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban]
Mmm, I gotta get it right, ooh, yeah
Get it right, ooh, yeah

[Chorus: Keith Urban]
There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home, home, home, mmm
Coming home, home, home, mmm
Coming home

[Bridge: Julia Michaels and Keith Urban]
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same (just not the same)
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same (just not the same)
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same

[Chorus: Keith Urban and Julia Michaels]
There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me (oh, baby)
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like (hey!)
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go (yeah!)
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home

[Outro: Keith Urban and Julia Michaels]
(Nothin' in the world)
I'm feeling lost in all the madness
(Nothin' in the world that feels like I'm)
I need somewhere to ease my mind
Coming home (comin' home)
These sidewalks filled with different faces (ooh-hoo)
So many places, but there's none like mine
Coming home



[Verse 1]
The rain is coming down tonight
I'm smiling, looking at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flying right back to when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be running them streets like we owned the town

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on a two lane road
Had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good

[Chorus 1]
When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loko's, Spark, and Light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time

[Verse 2]
Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the grit and the game

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
We had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good

[Chorus 2]
When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loco's, spark a light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, now
Summer dresses dryin' out on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all

[Chorus 3]
When I think about those summer nights
Sneaking out the window, running back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
We were swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time

[Outro]
Hey, you know oh
All that wasted time
Don't you feel it coming on back now
Time, time, time



[Verse 1: Keith Urban]
She's going to Coachella with feathers in her hair
She got the past and a dream catcher in her rear-view mirror (woah)
Oh, the band on her shirt, they're comin on at 9
She doesn't even know right now where she's gonna stay tonight, she gon' stay tonight (woah)

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban]
She's on a mission, you can see
She's just gotta be free
Red lips on a refugee

[Chorus: Kassi Ashton & Both]
Saturday night, feeling alright
Show him what he lost in my jeans skin tight
Stars coming out, the music up loud
Saturday night, feeling alright
Shades on, dancing with my hands up high
Stars coming out, the music up loud

[Post-Chorus: Keith Urban]
She loves driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm
Driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 2: Keith Urban]
Palm trees fading like a summer fling
Crystals on the dash, everybody singing "The Shape of You," mmm (woah)
Yeah, Becky’s gone quiet on the passenger side
And Maddie's in the back, just a little too high

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban]
Looking like a teenage dream
Red lips on a refugee

[Chorus: Kassi Ashton & Both]
Saturday night, feeling alright
Show him what he lost with my jeans skin tight
Stars coming out, the music up loud
Saturday night, feeling alright
Shades on, dancing with my hands up high
Stars coming out, the music up loud

[Post-Chorus: Keith Urban]
She loves driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm
Yeah, driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm

[Bridge: Keith Urban]
Everybody sing
Mmm, mmm
Oh
Driving with her drop top

[Chorus: Kassi Ashton, (Keith Urban) & Both]
Saturday night, feeling alright
Show him what he lost with my jeans skin tight (hey)
Stars coming out, the music up loud
Saturday night, feeling alright (I'm feeling alright)
Shades on, dancing with my hands up high (with my hands up high)
Stars coming out, the music up loud

[Post-Chorus: Keith Urban]
She loves driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm
Driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm
Oh, driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm
She's always driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm



[Verse 1: Keith Urban]
Sometimes you get a little bit frightened
Afraid of the wind and the lightning
Sometimes you get a little bit insecure
Sometimes you wonder if you're even good enough
Hiding from the morning when it's too much
But there's so much waiting behind the door

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban]
And I know and I know and I know
That you just wanna dance in the light
Don't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?
You're alive

[Chorus: Keith Urban & Lindsay Ell]
So just let your horses run
To the limit like never before
Let's be lost and young
Wanna show you what your heart is made for
Let your horses run
Run, run, run, oh
Let your horses run
Run, run, run

[Verse 2: Keith Urban]
I saw you on the street just the other day
You looked so pretty when you smiled that way
So open up the door, let your heart escape

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban]
'Cause I know and I know and I know
That you just wanna dance in the light
Don't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?
You're alive

[Chorus: Keith Urban & Lindsay Ell]
So just let your horses run
To the limit like never before
Let's be lost and young
Wanna show you what your heart is made for
Let your horses run
Run, run, run, oh
Let your horses run
Run, run, run

[Post-Chorus: Keith Urban]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban]
And I know and I know and I know
That you just wanna dance in the light
Don't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?
You're alive
'Cause I know and I know and I know
That you just wanna dance in the light
Don't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?
You're alive, you're alive

[Chorus: Keith Urban & Lindsay Ell]
Let your horses run
To the limit like never before
Let's be lost and young (I wanna be lost)
Wanna show you what your heart is made for (show you)
Let your horses run
Run, run, run, oh
Let your horses run
Run, run, run, oh

[Post-Chorus: Keith Urban]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let 'em run
Dance in the light
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh
Run, run, run
Ooh
