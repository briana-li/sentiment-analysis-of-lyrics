Long ago
Just like the hearse you die to get in again
We are so far from you
Burning on
Just like the match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know
And what's the worst you take
From every heart you break
And like the blade you stain
Well I've been holding on tonight
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long not goodnight
Came a time
When every star fall
Brought you to tears again
We are the very hurt you sold
And what's the worst you take
From every heart you break
And like the blade you stain
Well I've been holding on tonight
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long not goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long not goodnight
Can you hear me?
Are you near me?
Can we pretend to leave and then
We'll meet again
When both our cars collide
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long not goodnight
And if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?"
He said, "Will you defeat them?
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?"
"Because one day, I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade"
When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?"
Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know
We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call
To carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches
On and on, we carry through the fears
Oh, oh, oh
Disappointed faces of your peers
Oh, oh, oh
Take a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care
We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
Well, if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? 
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means 
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out
Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay now 
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay! 
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Well, I'm not okay, I'm not o-fucking-kay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
Another cog in the murder machine
They said "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So, darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
The boys and girls in the clique
The awful names that they stick
You're never gonna fit in much, kid
But if you're troubled and hurt
What you got under your shirt
Will make them pay for the things that they did
They said "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So, darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
Oh, yeah!
They said "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So, darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
All together now!
"Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So, darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
"Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So, darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
The future is bulletproof
The aftermath is secondary
It's time to do it now and do it loud
Killjoys, make some noise!
Na, na na, na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na, na na, na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na, na na, na, na na
Na, na na na, na na
Na, na na na na
Drugs, gimme drugs
Gimme drugs, I don't need it
But I'll sell what you got
Take the cash and I'll keep it
Eight legs to the wall
Hit the gas, kill em' all
And we crawl, and we crawl, and we crawl
You be my detonator
Love, gimme love
Gimme love, I don't need it
But I'll take what I want from your heart
And I'll keep it in a bag, in a box
Put an "X" on the floor
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more
Shut up and sing it with me
 From mall security
 To every enemy
 We're on your property
Standing in V formation
 Let's blow an artery
 Eat plastic surgery
 Keep your apology
Give us more detonation
More, gimme more, gimme more!
"Oh let me tell you 'bout the sad man"
Shut up and let me see your jazz hands
Remember when you were a mad man
Thought you was Batman
And hit the party with a gas can?
Kiss me, you animal!
 You run the company
 Fuck like a Kennedy
 I think we'd rather be
Burning your information
 Let's blow an artery
 Eat plastic surgery
 Keep your apology
Give us more detonation
And right here, right now
All the way in Battery City
The little children raise their open filthy palms
Like tiny daggers up to heaven
And all the juvie halls
And the Ritalin rats
Ask angels made from neon and fucking garbage
Scream out, "What will save us?"
And the sky opened up
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die
Wanna try, wanna try, wanna try
Wanna try, wanna try now
I'll be your detonator
 Make no apology
 It's death or victory
 On my authority
Crash and burn, young and loaded
 Drop like a bullet shell
 Dress like a sleeper cell
 I'd rather go to Hell than be in purgatory
Cut my hair, gag and bore me
Pull this pin, let this world explode
Now, I know that I can't make you stay
But where's your heart?
But where's your heart?
But where's your...
And I know there's nothing I can say
To change that part
To change that part
To change...
So many bright lights, they cast a shadow
But can I speak?
Well, is it hard understanding I'm incomplete?
A life that's so demanding, I get so weak
A love that's so demanding, I can't speak
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world, alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
Can you see, my eyes are shining bright
'Cause I'm out here, on the other side
Of a jet black hotel mirror, and I'm so weak
Is it hard understanding I'm incomplete?
A love that's so demanding, I get weak
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world, alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world, alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
These bright lights have always blinded me
These bright lights have always blinded me
I say
I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead
'Cause I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead
I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead
I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world, alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world, alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world, alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
Turn away, if you could get me a drink
Of water cause my lips are chapped and faded
Call my aunt Marie, help her gather all my things
And bury me in all my favorite colors
My sisters and my brothers, still, I will not kiss you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
Now turn away 'cause I'm awful just to see
'Cause all my hairs abandoned all my body
Oh, my agony, know that I will never marry
Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo
But counting down the days to go
It just ain't living and I just hope you know
That if you say  goodbye today 
I'd ask you to be true 
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
I never said I'd lie and wait forever
If I died, we'd be together
I can't always just forget her
But she could try
At the end of the world or the last thing I see
You are, never coming home, never coming home
Could I? Should I?
And all the things that you never ever told me
And all the smiles that are ever ever
Ever get the feeling that you're never all alone?
And I remember now
At the top of my lungs in my arms, she dies
She dies
At the end of the world or the last thing I see
You are, never coming home, never coming home
Could I? Should I?
And all the things that you never ever told me
And all the smiles that are ever gonna haunt me
Never coming home, never coming home
Could I? Should I?
And all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me
For all the ghosts that are never gonna catch me
If I fall
If I fall 
Woah, woah!
Woah. woah!
Woah, woah!
Woah, woah!
At the end of the world or the last thing I see
You are, never coming home, never coming home
Never coming home, never coming home
And all the things that you never ever told me
And all the smiles that are ever going to haunt me
Never coming home, never coming home
Could I? Should I?
And all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me
For all the ghosts that are never gonna
Well, when you go
Don't ever think I'll make you try to stay
And maybe when you get back
I'll be off to find another way
And after all this time that you still owe
You're still a good-for-nothing I don't know
So take your gloves and get out
Better get out while you can
When you go, would you even turn to say
"I don't love you like I did yesterday?"
Sometimes, I cry so hard from pleading
So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby, when they knock you down and out
Is where you ought to stay
And after all the blood that you still owe
Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up while you can
Whoa, whoa, whoa
When you go, would you even turn to say
"I don't love you like I did yesterday?"
Well, come on, come on
When you go, would you have the guts to say
"I don't love you like I loved you yesterday?"
I don't love you like I loved you yesterday
I don't love you like I loved you yesterday
Mama, we all go to hell
Mama, we all go to hell
I'm writing this letter and wishing you well
Mama, we all go to hell
Oh well now, Mama, we're all gonna die
Mama, we're all gonna die
Stop asking me questions, I'd hate to see you cry
Mama, we're all gonna die
And when we go, don't blame us, yeah
We'll let the fires just bathe us, yeah
You made us oh, so famous, we'll never let you go
And when you go, don't return to me, my love
Mama, we're all full of lies
Mama, we're meant for the flies
And right now, they're building a coffin your size
Mama, we're all full of lies
Well mother, what the war did to my legs and to my tongue
You should've raised a baby girl, I should've been a better son
If you could coddle the infection, they can amputate at once
You should've been, I could have been a better son
And when we go, don't blame us, yeah
We'll let the fires just bathe us, yeah
You made us oh, so famous
We'll never let you go
She said, "You ain't no son of mine
For what you've done, they're gonna find
A place for you and just you mind your manners when you go
And when you go, don't return to me, my love"
That's right
Mama, we all go to hell
Mama, we all go to hell
It's really quite pleasant, except for the smell
Mama, we all go to hell
Mama! Mama! Mama! Oh!
Mama! Mama! Mama! Ma...
And if you would call me a sweetheart
I'd maybe then sing you a song
But there's shit that I've done with this fuck of a gun
You would cry out your eyes, all along
We're damned, after all
Through fortune and flame, we fall
And if you can stay, then I'll show you the way
To return from the ashes you call
We all carry on
When our brothers in arms are gone
So raise your glass high, for tomorrow, we die
And return from the ashes you call
