[Verse 1]
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care, baby, by the way

[Chorus]
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

[Verse 2]
Here come bad news, talking this and that (Yeah!)
Well, give me all you got, don't hold it back (Yeah!)
Well, I should probably warn ya, I'll be just fine (Yeah!)

Can't nothing bring me down, I said

[Verse 1]
Hold on to me
Don't let me go
Who cares what they see
Who cares what they know?
Your first name is Free
Last name is Dom
Cause you still believe
In where we’re from

[Chorus]
Man's red flower
It's in every living thing
Mind, use your power
Spirit, use your wings
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom

[Verse 2]
Hold on to me
Don't let me go
Cheetahs need to eat
Run, antelope
Your first name is King
Last name is Dom
Cause you still believe
In everyone

[Chorus]
When a baby first breathes
When night sees sunrise
When the whale hops the sea
When man recognizes
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom
Freedom
Breathe in

[Verse 3]
We are from heat
The electric one
Does it shock you to see
He left us the sun?
Atoms in the air
Organisms in the sea
The sun and yes, man
Are made of the same things

[Outro]
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom

[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Different

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
This one goes out to all the lovers
What can we do? We're helpless romantics
We can not help who we're attracted to
So let's all dance, and elevate each other

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Dear diary, it's happenin' again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe
Who? Cleopatra? Please
Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothin' to me
I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Why, why do I have to lie?
Pretend, make believe or hide her?
When I love what I've described
But then again, I don't need no adjectives for this girl

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Dear diary, it's happenin' again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe
Who? Cleopatra? Please
Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothin' to me
I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough
Dear diary, it's happenin' again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe
Who? Cleopatra? Please
Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothin' to me
I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that? Yeah
What's wrong with that?

[Interlude: Kelly Osbourne]
In honor of the groove and all who's surrendered to it
We say thank you, and we take it back

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
Wished so hard, I wished so hard that it came true
Then my lucky star, I guess you came from behind the moon
I put my arms around her, and I promise not to abuse you
Since now I found you, why the hell would I want to lose you?

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Dear diary, it's happenin' again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe

Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothin' to me

I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough



[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Don't wanna sound full of myself or rude
But you ain't looking at no other dudes
'Cause you love me (I'm sorry baby, so sexy)
So you think about a chance
You find yourself trying to do my dance
Maybe 'cause you love me (Uh, you do it well)

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
So then we tried singing it slow now
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (Fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear your ass up (Tear your ass up)

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin' (You know I want you, babe)
I'm ready to bury it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I want ya (You should stop frontin', babe)

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Trying to be the best girlfriend you could be
But still you sneak and look at me, and girl, I love it
Then you give your other girl a shove
Tell her you gonna call her ass how it was
And she's gonna love it (Whoa-oh whoa, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
So then we tried singing it slow now
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (Fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear your ass up (Tear your ass up)

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin' (You know I want you, babe)
I'm ready to bury it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I want ya (You should stop frontin', babe)

[Bridge: Jay-Z & Pharrell]
Ho!
We got another one, Phar-real!
Dance, oooohhh
I call you "for real" cause you the truth, haha
Whoa-oh, ohhh-ohh
Young, great Hova
Dance, oooohhh
Uh, yeah, let me talk to 'em
Whoa-oh, ohhh-ohh
I'mma keep it real

[Verse 3: Jay-Z & Pharrell Williams]
Every time your name was brought up
I would act all nonchalant in front of an audience
Like you was just another shorty I put the naughty on
But uh, truth be told, you threw me for a loop, this Hov
I'm too old to be frontin' what I'm feelin'
Denzelin', actin' like you ain't appealin' when you are
Stuntin' like you ain't my only girl when you are
(I was just frontin') I'm ready to stop when you are

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin' (You know I want you, babe)
I'm ready to bury it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I want ya (You should stop frontin', babe)

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
C'mon (ho!)
Dance, oooohhh
Whoa-oh, (oh), ohhh-ohh
Dance, oooohhh (aoww!)
Whoa-oh, (oh), ohhh-ohh



[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
My heart is filled, with love and care
Not an ounce of gas, I would get up there
The answer's simple
You lift me up
The view up here, I see all the stars
There go Venus, and there go Mars
Somethin' you been through
You're from above, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
When I first saw you, I got excited
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it
But I didn't know
I didn't let go
Then it occurred to me while tryna fight it
Just like a kite, you learn to ride it
But I didn't know
You s'posed to let it go

[Chorus: Daft Punk]
Like a gust of wind
You head me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind
You remind me there's someone up there
Who ushers in
The air I need to power my sail

[Post-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
When I open the window
I wanna hug you
Cause you remind me of the air
I said yeah
Cause when I'm feelin' real low
I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
With your love, I can board the skies
Riding away that electrified mothership other
Can I stow away? (Can I stow away girl, girl?)
Colourful winds of the northern sky
Is the closest thing, and here is why
Cause we're color
You blow me away (blow me away girl, girl)

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I need it like I breathe it
Music and colors can make one hover
Who cares if they don't see you?
Don't you know that they're the same?
I need it like I breathe it
If you never discover, forever you'll suffer
Who cares if they don't see you?
You gotta tap in and learn the way

[Chorus: Daft Punk]
Like a gust of wind
You head me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind
You remind me there's someone up there
Who ushers in
The air I need to power my sail

[Post-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
When I open the window
I wanna hug you
Cause you remind me of the air
I said yeah
Cause when I'm feelin' real low
I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus: Pharell Wiliams]
When I first saw you, I got excited
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it
But I didn't know
I didn't let it go
Then I realized I'm trying to fight it
Just so they can learn to ride it
But I didn't know, oh
I had to let it go

[Chorus: Daft Punk and Pharrell Williams]
Like a gust of wind
You head me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind
You remind me there's someone up there
Who ushers in
The air I need to power my sail

[Post-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
When I open the window
I wanna hug you
Cause you remind me of the air
I said yeah
Cause when I'm feelin' real low
I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there



[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
The truth will set you free
But first, it'll piss you off

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Hate! Bad bitches wanna be my bae
Hate! Hunt me down like the C.I.A
Hate! Side of my car, tryna see my face
Hate! Want me to beat it like the T.I. case
Oh (hate!) and if it's heated I'ma feed my face

Hate! Hatin' niggas can't believe my race
Hate! Niggas hit you with the Eli face, oh

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams]

Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Hate! You keep askin' me where I'm from
Hate! About the borders and, "Did I run?"
Hate! Keep askin' how I feel 'bout guns
Hate! There's a light and dark army, which side you choose? Oh
Hate! If not now then when?
Hate! And if not me then who?
Hate! Don't drink the Kool-Aid, my friends
Hate! I tried to tell y'all about this dude

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I get it how I live it
I live it how I get it
Count the mothafuckin' digits
I pull up with a lemon
Not 'cause she ain't livin'
It's just your eyes get acidic
And this here ain't a scrimmage
Mothafucka, we ain't finished
I told you we won't stop
A nigga 'bouta business
Like yours, but you rent it
Wave hello to the top
Nigga the Veyron glide
Tell the paparazzi get the lens right
Got the window down, top, blowin' la
Got the hazards on, only doin' five

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
You can find P, Skateboard in the La Ferrar'
And the truck behind me got arms
Yeah, longer than LeBron
Just waitin' for my thumb like The Fonz
Woo! This beat tastes like lunch
But it's runnin' from veneers and it's runnin' from the fronts
But everyday, hey, wasn't lemonade
I was afraid, once a nigga graduate
Would I be okay?
So I prayed and I played
Nigga, i am OTHER, we got our office in space
Warp speed, Doctor Spock couldn't chase, nigga

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I get it how I live it
I live it how I get it
Count the mothafuckin' digits
I pull up with a lemon
Not 'cause she ain't livin'
It's just your eyes get acidic
And this here ain't a scrimmage
Mothafucka, we ain't finished
I told you we won't stop
A nigga 'bouta business
Like yours, but you rent it
Wave hello to the top
Nigga the Veyron glide
Tell the paparazzi get the lens right
Got the window down, top, blowin' la
Got the hazards on, only doin' five
You can catch me...

Just because it's the middle of night
That don't mean I won't hunt you down
Cause up, in, deep inside
It's pullin' me and I want your love
You and I should be gettin' it right
Ain't no sense in you holdin' on down

Come get eaten by the damn mirage

[Pre-Chorus]
What planet are you from, girl?
And are there others like you there?
And could you do that magic trick again?
Poppin' up from nowhere
Though my planet's full of warfare
You make it feel like a dream
Man I hope they never find you

[Chorus]
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Hot sex and gold, shiny things
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Remind you that you are a lost queen
I think you are a lost queen

[Verse 1]
I don't have a problem with multi-taskin'
Takin' care of you is my number one passion
Put it before my eyes, you know I'ma smash it
Only if you want it, want it
You don't have to ever think about askin'
I can read your mind, girl, of course I have it
Can I start you up? It's automatic
Get your motor runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom
I'm never too busy to tell you that you're pretty
Ain't gotta ask me to
Surprise you in the city when your day is goin' shitty
Ain't gotta ask me to

[Pre-Chorus]
What planet are you from, girl?
And are there others like you there?
And could you do that magic trick again?
Poppin' up from nowhere
Though my planet's full of warfare
You make it feel like a dream
Man I hope they never find you

[Chorus]
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Hot sex and gold, shiny things
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Remind you that you are a lost queen
I think you are a lost queen

[Verse 2]
I don’t have a problem meeting mommy and daddy
Honey and sugar, man I bet they're so classy
Half of me is good, the other half nasty
Can't help it if I want it, want it
Sure I meet your friends on my best behavior
Talk about relationships, I used to be a player
And like GEICO, the time I saved 'em
And get their motors runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom
Lift your head when you're down so you don't drop your crown
Ain't gotta ask me to
And right before we finish, I'll ask you did you get it
Ain't gotta ask me to

[Pre-Chorus]
What planet are you from, girl?
And are there others like you there?
And could you do that magic trick again?
Poppin' up from nowhere
Though my planet's full of warfare
You make it feel like a dream
Man I hope they never find you

[Chorus]
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Hot sex and gold, shiny things
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Remind you that you are a lost queen
I think you are a lost queen
