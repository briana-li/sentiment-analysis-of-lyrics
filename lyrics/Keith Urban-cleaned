I can...
See you over there starin' at your drink
Watchin' that ice sink, all alone tonight
And...
Chances are you're sittin' here in this bar
'Cause he ain't gonna treat you right
Well, it's...
Probably not my place but I'm gonna say it anyway
‘Cause you look like
You...
Haven’t felt the fire, had a little fun
Hadn’t had a smile in a little while, baby
Blue...
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall
But darlin', it don’t match your eyes
I’m tellin’ you...
You don’t need that guy
It’s so black and white, he’s stealin’ your thunder
Baby, blue ain’t your color
I'm not tryna...
Be another just pick you up kinda guy
Tryna drink you up, tryna take you home
But I just...
I don't understand how another man
Can take your sun and turn it ice cold
Well, I've...
Had enough to drink and it's makin' me think
That I just might
Tell you...
If I were a painter I wouldn’t change ya
I’d just paint you bright, baby
'Cause blue...
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall
But darlin', it don’t match your eyes
I’m tellin’ you...
You don’t need that guy
It’s so black and white, he’s stealin’ your thunder
Baby, blue ain’t your color
No, no, no
Mmmm

Mmm, baby
Blue...
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall
But darlin', it don’t match your eyes
I’m tellin’ you...
You don’t need that guy
It’s so black and white, he’s stealin’ your thunder
Baby, blue ain’t your color
Blue ain’t your color
Mmm, no, no, no baby
Come here, baby
Let me light up your world
When you hear somebody say somebody hits like a girl
How does that hit you?
Is that such a bad thing?
When you hear a song that they play sayin' you run the world
Do you believe it?
Will you live to see it?
Sister, shoulder
Daughter, lover
Healer, broken halo
Mother nature
Fire, suit of armor
Sole survivor, Holy Water
Secret keeper, fortune teller
Virgin Mary, scarlet letter
Technicolor, river wild
Baby, girl, woman, child
Female
When somebody laughs and implies that she asked for it
Just cause she was wearing a skirt
Oh, is that how that works?
When somebody talks about how it was Adam first
Does that make you second best?
Or did he save the best for last?

I'm a 45 spinning on an old Victrola
I'm a two-strike swinger, I'm a Pepsi Cola
I'm a blue jean quarterback saying "I love you" to the prom queen
In a Chevy
I'm John Wayne, Superman, California
I'm a Kris Kristofferson, Sunday morning
I'm a mama and daddy singing along to Don McLean
At the levee
And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16
Hey, hey
Everything I needed
That's right
I'm Mark Twain on the Mississippi
I'm Hemingway with a shot of whiskey
I'm a TV dinner on a tray trying to figure out the Wheel of Fortune
I'm a Texaco star, I'm a Gibson guitar
I'm still a teenage kid trying to go too far
I'm a jukebox waiting in a neon bar for a quarter
And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16
I spent a lot of years running from believing
Looking for another way to save my soul
The longer I live, the more I see it
There's only one way home
And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16
Oh, I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old 
Another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16
Everything I needed
Everything I needed
Oh, that's right
I know he hurt you
Made you scared of love, too scared to love
He didn't deserve you
'Cause your precious heart is a precious heart
He didn't know what he had and I thank God, oh, oh, oh
And it's gonna take just a little time
But you're gonna see that I was born to love you
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
Look in the mirror
You're beautiful, so beautiful
I'm here to remind you
You're my only one, let me be the one
To heal all the pain that he put you through
It's a love like you never knew
Just let me show you
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise, I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
I wanna believe that you got me, baby
I swear I do from now until the next life
I wanna love, wanna give you all my heart
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
What if I cry?
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
You said "I love you" to me
And I don't know what that means
So I froze on my feet
People use it so carelessly
And I couldn’t believe
That you would dive in so deep
And you said perfectly
Everything I’ve been feelin' about you
It’s time to break the chains that held me back from you
So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line
Well I was never the type
To put it all on the line
But I've been changing my mind since you opened my eyes
It was the way that the light
Picked you out of that night
Then you were right by my side
Put a soul in my body
And now it’s time to close the space between the two of us
So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line
Oh, baby it's time
Oh, it's time
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line
And put our hearts in a parallel line
And put our hearts in a parallel line
There'll be days your heart don't wanna beat
You pray more than you breathe
And you just wanna fall to pieces
And nights, those 2 AM calls
Where dreams become walls
And you just need a break
Break on me
Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me
There'll be times when someone you know
Becomes someone you knew
But you'd do anything to change it
And words you wanna take back
But you know you can't
When the page just won't turn
And it still hurts
Break on me
Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me
Oh, when you need somebody
When you need somebody right now
You're where I'll be
Break on me
Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me
Break on me
Break on me, baby
Hmmmm
I wake up feeling, in my soul I'm
Living someone else's life
I'm turnin' into concrete, harder than these city streets
Where no one even cares if I'm alive
I gotta get it right, mmm
Get it right, mmm mmm
There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home, home, home, mmm
Coming home
My mind's heavy and I can't sleep, not even a memory
Is good enough to get me through the night, mmm
I'm longin' for the real thing, people who know the real me
And all the ways to love me back to life
Mmm, I gotta get it right, ooh, yeah
Get it right, ooh, yeah
There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home, home, home, mmm
Coming home, home, home, mmm
Coming home
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same 
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same 
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same
There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me 
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like 
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go 
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home
I'm feeling lost in all the madness
I need somewhere to ease my mind
Coming home 
These sidewalks filled with different faces 
So many places, but there's none like mine
Coming home
The rain is coming down tonight
I'm smiling, looking at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flying right back to when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be running them streets like we owned the town
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on a two lane road
Had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good
When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loko's, Spark, and Light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the grit and the game
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
We had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good
When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loco's, spark a light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time
Hey, hey, now
Summer dresses dryin' out on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all
When I think about those summer nights
Sneaking out the window, running back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
We were swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time
Hey, you know oh
All that wasted time
Don't you feel it coming on back now
Time, time, time
She's going to Coachella with feathers in her hair
She got the past and a dream catcher in her rear-view mirror 
Oh, the band on her shirt, they're comin on at 9
She doesn't even know right now where she's gonna stay tonight, she gon' stay tonight 
She's on a mission, you can see
She's just gotta be free
Red lips on a refugee
Saturday night, feeling alright
Show him what he lost in my jeans skin tight
Stars coming out, the music up loud
Saturday night, feeling alright
Shades on, dancing with my hands up high
Stars coming out, the music up loud
She loves driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm
Driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm
Palm trees fading like a summer fling
Crystals on the dash, everybody singing "The Shape of You," mmm 
Yeah, Becky’s gone quiet on the passenger side
And Maddie's in the back, just a little too high
Looking like a teenage dream
Red lips on a refugee
Saturday night, feeling alright
Show him what he lost with my jeans skin tight
Stars coming out, the music up loud
Saturday night, feeling alright
Shades on, dancing with my hands up high
Stars coming out, the music up loud
She loves driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm
Yeah, driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm
Everybody sing
Mmm, mmm
Oh
Driving with her drop top
 & Both]
Saturday night, feeling alright
Show him what he lost with my jeans skin tight 
Stars coming out, the music up loud
Saturday night, feeling alright 
Shades on, dancing with my hands up high 
Stars coming out, the music up loud
She loves driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm
Driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm
Oh, driving with her drop top down

She's always driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm
Sometimes you get a little bit frightened
Afraid of the wind and the lightning
Sometimes you get a little bit insecure
Sometimes you wonder if you're even good enough
Hiding from the morning when it's too much
But there's so much waiting behind the door
And I know and I know and I know
That you just wanna dance in the light
Don't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?
You're alive
So just let your horses run
To the limit like never before
Let's be lost and young
Wanna show you what your heart is made for
Let your horses run
Run, run, run, oh
Let your horses run
Run, run, run
I saw you on the street just the other day
You looked so pretty when you smiled that way
So open up the door, let your heart escape
'Cause I know and I know and I know
That you just wanna dance in the light
Don't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?
You're alive
So just let your horses run
To the limit like never before
Let's be lost and young
Wanna show you what your heart is made for
Let your horses run
Run, run, run, oh
Let your horses run
Run, run, run
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And I know and I know and I know
That you just wanna dance in the light
Don't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?
You're alive
'Cause I know and I know and I know
That you just wanna dance in the light
Don't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?
You're alive, you're alive
Let your horses run
To the limit like never before
Let's be lost and young 
Wanna show you what your heart is made for 
Let your horses run
Run, run, run, oh
Let your horses run
Run, run, run, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let 'em run
Dance in the light
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh
Run, run, run
Ooh
