Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
I'm so fuckin'—
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that 
She taught me love 
She taught me patience 
How she handles pain 
That shit's amazing 
I've loved and I've lost 
But that's not what I see 
'Cause look what I've found 
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fucking—
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash 
I've got so much love 
Got so much patience 
I've learned from the pain 
I turned out amazing 
Say I've loved and I've lost 
But that's not what I see 
'Cause look what I've found 
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next

Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me
"Excuse me, um, I love you"
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
You're like:
"I love you—who starts a conversation like that?"
Nobody but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, I tried to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real? 
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh no
Wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you're such a dream
If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mmm, boy
I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, "What happened? Why you?"
But when I see you in my dreams, psh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it
