[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin'—

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fucking—

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say

So baby, take my hands, save your soul
We can make it last, take it slow, hmm
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it, yeah

Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'

Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated
Time goes by and I can't control my mind

[Intro: Ariana Grande]
Last night, boy, I met you, yeah
When I was asleep (sleep)
You're such a dream to me, mmm, woah
And it was on a day like this, yeah
If you can believe, if you can believe (if you can believe)
You're such a dream to me

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
"Excuse me, um, I love you"
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
You're like:
"I love you—who starts a conversation like that?"
Nobody but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, I tried to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real? (Is this real?)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh no
Wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you're such a dream
If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mmm, boy

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande & Pharrell]
I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, "What happened? Why you?"
But when I see you in my dreams, psh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it (I know how to keep it)
The Good Housekeeping Seal
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel
What about La Perla? Let Vickie keep her secret
Boy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it, oh

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
(No I don't want, no)
'Cause you're such a dream (does this end?)
If you can believe, you're such a dream to me
To me, mmm, boy, to me



[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I just broke up with my ex
Now I’m out here single, I don’t really know what’s next
But I ain’t even trippin', I'mma chill and sit back
And I know they will be coming from the right
And the left, left, left

You're the one I’m feeling as I'm laying on your chest
Good conversation got me holding my breath
And I don’t normally say this but goddamn

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
As I'm laying on your chest
I'll be out here thinkin' 'bout it, boy, it's just a guess
But something just keeps telling me I'm better than the rest
And I ain't tryna rush you, but goddamn, I'm a mess, mess, mess

And if it feels right, promise I don't mind
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night

She say "you need to stop fuckin' with them thots, boy"
I say "You need a real nigga," she said, "Yes, Lord"
And what you need your ex for? I'm triple X, Lord
Okay, Ariana my lil mama, goodbye to the good girl
My ex tripping, it's no Biggie, I 2Pac, shook her
I'm laid up with my new thing, she lay her head on my new chain
Then the mood change, my name change from 'Lil Wayne' to 'Ooh, Wayne'
Oh Lord, she grinding on this Grande, oh Lord
I'm drowning, I'm gonna need that coast guard
And when it comes to that nigga, I give her amnesia
She just looking for love, she says she single and I'm her feature
Oh, my God

You don't wait, tell 'em wait another round
Ah, guess you're way above it now
And that's your way to love it now

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
How can they tell you shit that you've been through?
They are so confused, who cares about their rationale?
If it ain't your view
That's the bottom line
Know-it-all (know-it-all)
Give you a box of chances, every time you blow it all (blow it all)

Why do we have chemistry?
With a need for speed
Doin' things that trouble clings to
And burns off our wings

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
Ah, gonna break that shit down
You don't wait, tell 'em wait another round
Ah, guess you're way above it now
And that's your way to love it now

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
How can they tell you shit that you've been through?
They are so confused, who cares about their rationale?
If it ain't your view
That's the bottom line
Know-it-all (know-it-all)
Give you a box of chances, every time you blow it all (blow it all)
As if it were shade, you would just throw it all (throw it all)
It's like you're trying not to glow at all (glow at all)
Know-it-all (know-it-all)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
The light is coming to give back everything the darkness stole, stole, st-st-stole
You wouldn't let anybody speak and instead—
The light is coming to give back everything the darkness stole
You wouldn't let anybody speak and instead—
The light is coming to give back everything the darkness stole, stole, stole
You wouldn't let anybody speak and instead—
The light is coming to give back everything the darkness stole
You wouldn't let anybody speak and instead—
The light is coming to give back everything the darkness stole, stole, st-st-stole
You wouldn't let anybody speak and instead—
The light is coming to give back everything the darkness stole
You wouldn't let anybody speak and inst—
