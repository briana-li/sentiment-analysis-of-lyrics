It's so unusual it's frightening
You see right through the mess inside me
And you call me out to pull me in
You tell me I can start again
And I don't need to keep on hiding
I'm fully known and loved by You
You won't let go no matter what I do
And it's not one or the other
It's hard truth and ridiculous grace
To be known fully known and loved by You
I'm fully known and loved by You
It's so like You to keep pursuing
It's so like me to go astray
But You guard my heart with Your truth
A kind of love that's bullet proof
And I surrender to Your kindness
I'm fully known and loved by You
You won't let go no matter what I do
And it's not one or the other
It's hard truth and ridiculous grace
To be known fully known and loved by You
I'm fully known and loved by You
How real, how wide
How rich, how high is Your heart
I cannot find the reasons why
You give me so much
How real, how wide
How rich, how high is Your heart
I cannot find the reasons why
You give me so much
I'm fully known and loved by You
You won't let go no matter what I do
And it's not one or the other
It's hard truth and ridiculous grace
To be known fully known and loved by You
I'm fully known and loved by You
It's so unusual it's frightening
I'm fully known and loved by You
People hurting, people broken
Beaten down and feeling hopeless
Wonder if it’s gonna always be this way
Who will speak up for the captive
Show some love and heal a past that
Binds the wounds we think will never go away
But what if we could be a people on our knees
As one before the King
'Cause we believe
All the world starts changing
When the church starts praying
Strongholds start to break
Oh, when we pray
Prison walls start shaking
At the sound of praising
Nothing stays the same
Oh, when we pray
Oh, when we pray, oh
I see revival rising
I see hope on the horizon
As a generation stepping out in faith
Because we will be a people on our knees
As one before the King
Yeah we believe
All the world starts changing
When the church starts praying
Strongholds start to break
Oh, when we pray
Prison walls start shaking
At the sound of praising
Nothing stays the same
Oh, when we pray
Oh, when we pray, oh
Let Your kingdom come, Lord
Let Your will be done
All the world starts changing
When the church starts praying
Strongholds start to break
Oh, when we pray
All the world starts changing
When the church starts praying
Strongholds start to break
Oh, when we pray
Prison walls start shaking
At the sound of praising
Nothing stays the same
Oh, when we pray, oh
When we pray, oh
In Jesus name 
In Jesus name 
When we pray, oh
When we pray
O-o-o-o-o-ohh
O-o-o-o-o-ohh
Standing in your ruins feels a lot like the end
So used to losing, you're afraid to try again
Right now all you see are ashes
Where there was a flame
The truth is that you're not forgotten
'Cause Grace knows your name
God's not done with you
Even with your broken heart and your wounds and your scars
God's not done with you
Even when you're lost and it's hard and you're falling apart
God's not done with you
It's not over, it's only begun
So don't hide, don't run
'Cause God's not done with
You-ou-ou-ou-ou
You-ou-ou-ou-ou
There's​ a light you don't notice
Until you're standing in the dark
And there's a strength that's growing
Inside your shattered heart
Woah-o-o-o-o-oah
God's not done with you
Even with your broken heart and your wounds and your scars
God's not done with you
Even when you're lost and it's hard and you're falling apart
God's not done with you
It's not over, it's only begun
So don't hide, don't run
'Cause God's not done with
You-ou-ou-ou-ou
You-ou-ou-ou-ou
He's not done with you
You-ou-ou-ou-ou
You-ou-ou-ou-ou
He's got a plan, this is part of it
He's gonna finish what He started
He's got a plan, this is part of it
He's gonna finish what He started
He's not done
God's not done writing your story
No, He's not done
God's not done with you!!!
God's not done with you
God's not done with you
Even when you're lost and it's hard and you're falling apart
God's not done with you
It's not over, it's only begun
So don't hide, don't run
'Cause God's not done with
You, You 
You, You 
You-ou-ou-ou-ou
You-ou-ou-ou-ou
You, You
No, He's not done
God's not done with you
Struck down, persecuted
Under pressure, man that's how we do it
We at war, we at war
But have you even looked at the scoreboard?
Scoreboard, scoreboard
W's all day, whatchu scared for?
Scared for, scared for
Ain't nothing comin' at us
That we ain't prepared for
Undefeated
There's no stopping us
Undefeated
No doubt we're champions
Undefeated
Can't hold us down, we're rising up
Infinity and 0, unstoppable, you already know
We're undefeated 
I'm countin' my losses up as wins
'Cause Jesus be three-peatin', beatin' my sins
Nah, the boy ain't talkin' 'bout rings, ain't worried 'bout the bling
I been crowned by the King
March, madness, cuttin' down the nets
While I'm marchin' past my past with no regrets
And I'm steady lookin' to the hills like The Weeknd
In my weakness, grace is sufficient
Infinity and 0, Infinity and 0
And you already know
Undefeated
There's no stopping us
Undefeated
No doubt we're champions
Undefeated
Can't hold us down, we're rising up
Infinity and 0, unstoppable, you already know
We're undefeated 
I ain't takin' no L's
Singin' Noel in the summer boy
I ain't wanna go there, but oh well
'Cause we don't loose for nothin' boy
If we decease, indeed we will be again
Angels and demons, neither these heathens can
Ever get in between, I believe that we will win
Know the end like I cheated
Can't guarantee it, but Jesus can
Runnin' on Yom Kippur, this the fast track
On Yom Kippur, this the fast track
Even when they hatin' on me, homie I don't get mad
I just keep spittin' these glad raps
I came, I came, I sought, I sought
Conquered all, across the chart
And altered y'all, break off the wall
Hinges drop them off, taunt and flaunt
But homie all will awe 
Flawless, flawless, flawless, God of all this
Is appalled with y'all installments of heartless altars
As they fall apart when God is faultless
Infinity ending the enmity between God and me, killin' the darkness
Undefeated
There's no stoppin' us
Undefeated
No doubt we're champions
Undefeated
Can't hold us down, we're risin' up
Infinity and 0, unstoppable, you already know
Infinity and 0, unstoppable, you already know
We're undefeated 
Nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, but
Nothing, nothing, but
I'm chasing nothing but
Blinded by desire, heart's out of focus
Running past the truth, didn't even notice
Is who I've been who You've called me to be?
Is where I am where You want me?
I could have the fame, I could have the fortune
I could have it all, but I would still have nothing
Don't want my dreams to be an empty pursuit
‘Cause life is meaningless without You
I don't want to try to save my life
I want to lose it
I give it away, give it to You
Lord, You can use it, use it
I'm chasing nothing but…
Nothing, nothing
I'm chasing nothing but…You
Nothing, nothing
I'm chasing nothing but…
You, oh, You, oh, You, oh, You, oh, You, oh, You, oh, You, oh
I'm chasing nothing but You
I'm chasing nothing but You
I'm chasing nothing but You
Nothing but You
All I see is smoke, all I see are mirrors
Trying to find myself in a blurry picture
Just a glimpse of You is all that I need
Give You my life and you give it meaning
Desperate for the real, I don't want illusion
You're the only truth, there's no substituting
No substituting
Look, I was never really good at playing hide and seek
Well, I was really good at hiding, I just hate when I had to seek
And most of my friends would get mad at me
But I didn't realize what was happening
‘Cause how ironic looking back from growing up
That that's just how my life would be, until I found the key
Open up the good book, took a good look
And I couldn't get it out of my head, like a good hook
It showed me things that no one else really could
I just knew that I wanted more
That's a good cook
Nothing's stopping me
I got way too much passion inside of me
I spent way too much time living sloppily
Now I see that the prize is right in front of me
I don't want no fake love, that's that takes-but-never-gives love
I want that someone-would-die-just-to-save-my-life-wait-way-before-I-exist love
I looked everywhere, couldn't find it
I know it's here, where was it hiding?
Everything in my life going silent
Then I hear You calling my name, perfect timing
Chasing after You, I'm chasing after You
I look to You and no one else, ‘cause nothing else will do
And I'll follow You for however long this journey lasts
And I promise there's no looking back
And I'm chasing until everything fades to black
[Pre-Chorus
I don't want to try to save my life
I want to lose it
I give it away, give it to You
Lord, You can use it, use it
I'm chasing nothing but You
I don't want to try to save my life
I want to lose it
I give it away, give it to You
Lord, You can use it, use it
I'm chasing nothing but…
You, oh, You, oh, You, oh, You, oh, You, oh, You, oh, You, oh
I'm chasing nothing but You
I'm chasing nothing but…
You, oh, You, oh, You, oh, You, oh, You, oh, You, oh, You, oh
I'm chasing nothing but You
Do you remember the
21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away
Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
Ba duda, ba duda, ba duda, badu
Ba duda, badu, ba duda, badu
Ba duda, badu, ba duda
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now December found the love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember the true love we share today
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
There was a
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - golden dreams were shiny days
The bell was ringing, aha
Our souls were singing
Do you remember
Never a cloudy day
There was a
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
There was a
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - golden dreams were shiny days
Ba de ya de ya de ya
Ba de ya de ya de ya
Ba de ya de ya de ya
De ya
Ba de ya de ya de ya
Ba de ya de ya de ya
Ba de ya de ya de ya
Nobody changes the world
Standing in the crowd
Nobody's voice is ever heard
Until they open their mouth
Won't let our loud go quiet
Won't let the saints go silent
Let's turn it up
Tell the world what we're about
Hands reaching up toward Heaven
Hearts ready for what's next
Lights  breaking through the darkness
Camera, they ain't seen nothin' yet
Love is action that you take
Passion that can make
Any kind of wall come down
Love is action
Walking out our faith
Giving everything
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Love is action
Love is action
No, I'm not crazy to believe
Love can save a life
If we go running to the need
Leave apathy behind
We declare the fame of Jesus' name
Every second that we live our lives
Hands reaching up toward Heaven
Hearts ready for what's next
Lights breaking through the darkness
Camera, they ain't seen nothin' yet
Love is action that you take
Passion that can make
Any kind of wall come down
Love is action
Walking out our faith
Giving everything
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Love is action
Love is action
What have we been waiting for?
Somebody tell me
Push the pedal through the floor
Love at full speed
What have we been waiting for?
Somebody tell me
Push the pedal through the floor
Love at full speed
Love is action that you take
Passion that can make 
Any kind of wall come down
Love is action
Walking out our faith
Giving everything
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Love is action 
Love is action 
Love is action
I've been so numb
I don't know the last time
I felt a freedom that brought me to life
Words just don't work, don't know how to describe
The way I'm feelin'
What am I feelin'?
You got me rockin' like the ocean
Got me caught up in the moment
You're the only reason
For this supernatural feeling
It's more than just emotion
There is something taking over
You're the only reason
For this supernatural
Was down at the bottom so long I forgot
You've got the love that takes me to the top
Now that I'm floating I don't want to stop
The way I'm feelin'
What am I feelin'?
Supernatural, supernatural
Supernatural, your love is
Supernatural, supernatural
Supernatural, your love is
You got me rockin' like the ocean
Got me caught up in the moment
You're the only reason
For this supernatural feeling
It's more than just emotion
There is something taking over
You're the only reason
For this supernatural
I've walked among the shadows
You wiped my tears away
And I've felt the pain of heartbreak
And I've seen the brighter days
And I've prayed prayers to heaven
From my lowest place
And I have held Your blessings
God, You give and take away
No matter what I have, Your grace is enough
No matter where I am, I'm standing in Your love
On the mountains, I will bow my life
To the One who set me there
In the valley, I will lift my eyes
To the One who sees me there
When I'm standing on the mountain
I didn't get there on my own
When I'm walking through the valley
I know I am not alone!
You're God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys
Hi-hi-hills and valleys
God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys
And I am not alone
I've watched my dreams get broken
In You, I hope again
No matter what I know
I'm safe inside Your hands
On the mountains, I will bow my life
To the One who set me there 
In the valley, I will lift my eyes
To the One who sees me there
When I'm standing on the mountain
I didn't get there on my own
When I'm walking through the valley
I know I am not alone
You're God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys
Hi-hi-hills and valleys
God of the hills and valleys
And I am not alone
Father, You give and take away
Every joy and every pain
Through it all, You will remain
Over it all
Father, You give and take away
Every joy and every pain
Through it all, You will remain
Over it all
On the mountains, I will bow my life, yeah
In the valley, I will lift my eyes, yeah!
On the mountains, I will bow my life
To the One who set me there 
In the valley, I will lift my eyes
To the One who sees me there
When I'm standing on the mountain
I didn't get there on my own
When I'm walking through the valley
I know I am not alone 
You're God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys 
Hi-hi-hills and valleys
God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys 
And I am not alone
You're God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys 
Hi-hi-hills and valleys
God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys 
And I am not alone 
And I will choose to say
Blessed be Your Name
And I am not alone
Standing in your ruins, feels a lot like the end
So used to losing, you're afraid to try again
Right now all you see are ashes
Where there was a flame
The truth is that you're not forgotten
'Cause Grace knows your name
God's not done with you
Even with your broken heart and your wounds and your scars
God's not done with you
Even when you're lost and it's hard and you're falling apart

So don't hide, don't run
'Cause God's not done with
You-ou-ou-ou-ou
You-ou-ou-ou-ou
There's​ a light you don't notice
Until you're standing in the dark
