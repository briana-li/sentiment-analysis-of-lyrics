It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care, baby, by the way
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Here come bad news, talking this and that 
Well, give me all you got, don't hold it back 
Well, I should probably warn ya, I'll be just fine 
No offense to you, don’t waste your time, here's why
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you

Who cares what they see
Who cares what they know?
Your first name is Free
Last name is Dom

In where we’re from
Man's red flower
It's in every living thing
Mind, use your power
Spirit, use your wings
Freedom!

Don't let me go
Cheetahs need to eat
Run, antelope
Your first name is King
Last name is Dom
Cause you still believe
In everyone
When a baby first breathes
When night sees sunrise
When the whale hops the sea
When man recognizes
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom
Freedom
Breathe in
We are from heat
The electric one
Does it shock you to see
He left us the sun?
Atoms in the air
Organisms in the sea
The sun and yes, man
Are made of the same things
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom

Different
This one goes out to all the lovers
What can we do? We're helpless romantics
We can not help who we're attracted to
So let's all dance, and elevate each other
Dear diary, it's happenin' again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe
Who? Cleopatra? Please
Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothin' to me
I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough
Why, why do I have to lie?
Pretend, make believe or hide her?
When I love what I've described
But then again, I don't need no adjectives for this girl
Dear diary, it's happenin' again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear

Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that? Yeah
What's wrong with that?
In honor of the groove and all who's surrendered to it
We say thank you, and we take it back
Wished so hard, I wished so hard that it came true
Then my lucky star, I guess you came from behind the moon
I put my arms around her, and I promise not to abuse you
Since now I found you, why the hell would I want to lose you?

Don't wanna sound full of myself or rude
But you ain't looking at no other dudes
'Cause you love me 
So you think about a chance
You find yourself trying to do my dance
Maybe 'cause you love me 
So then we tried singing it slow now
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched 
Then we locked eyes and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear your ass up 
I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin' 
I'm ready to bury it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I want ya 
Trying to be the best girlfriend you could be
But still you sneak and look at me, and girl, I love it
Then you give your other girl a shove
Tell her you gonna call her ass how it was
And she's gonna love it 
So then we tried singing it slow now
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched 
Then we locked eyes and I knew I was in there

Uh, yeah, let me talk to 'em
Whoa-oh, ohhh-ohh

Every time your name was brought up
I would act all nonchalant in front of an audience
Like you was just another shorty I put the naughty on
But uh, truth be told, you threw me for a loop, this Hov
I'm too old to be frontin' what I'm feelin'
Denzelin', actin' like you ain't appealin' when you are
Stuntin' like you ain't my only girl when you are
 I'm ready to stop when you are
I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off

Whoa-oh, , ohhh-ohh
My heart is filled, with love and care
Not an ounce of gas, I would get up there
The answer's simple
You lift me up
The view up here, I see all the stars
There go Venus, and there go Mars
Somethin' you been through
You're from above, hey
When I first saw you, I got excited
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it
But I didn't know
I didn't let go
Then it occurred to me while tryna fight it
Just like a kite, you learn to ride it
But I didn't know
You s'posed to let it go
Like a gust of wind
You head me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind
You remind me there's someone up there
Who ushers in
The air I need to power my sail
When I open the window
I wanna hug you
Cause you remind me of the air
I said yeah
Cause when I'm feelin' real low
I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there
With your love, I can board the skies
Riding away that electrified mothership other
Can I stow away? 
Colourful winds of the northern sky
Is the closest thing, and here is why
Cause we're color
You blow me away 
I need it like I breathe it
Music and colors can make one hover
Who cares if they don't see you?
Don't you know that they're the same?
I need it like I breathe it
If you never discover, forever you'll suffer
Who cares if they don't see you?
You gotta tap in and learn the way
Like a gust of wind
You head me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind
You remind me there's someone up there
Who ushers in
The air I need to power my sail
When I open the window
I wanna hug you
Cause you remind me of the air

Cause when I'm feelin' real low
I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there
When I first saw you, I got excited
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it
But I didn't know
I didn't let it go
Then I realized I'm trying to fight it
Just so they can learn to ride it
But I didn't know, oh
I had to let it go
Like a gust of wind
You head me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind
You remind me there's someone up there
Who ushers in
The air I need to power my sail
When I open the window
I wanna hug you
Cause you remind me of the air
I said yeah
Cause when I'm feelin' real low
I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there
The truth will set you free
But first, it'll piss you off

What planet are you from, girl?
And are there others like you there?
And could you do that magic trick again?
Poppin' up from nowhere
Though my planet's full of warfare
You make it feel like a dream
Man I hope they never find you
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Hot sex and gold, shiny things
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Remind you that you are a lost queen
I think you are a lost queen
I don't have a problem with multi-taskin'
Takin' care of you is my number one passion
Put it before my eyes, you know I'ma smash it
Only if you want it, want it
You don't have to ever think about askin'
I can read your mind, girl, of course I have it
Can I start you up? It's automatic
Get your motor runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom
I'm never too busy to tell you that you're pretty
Ain't gotta ask me to
Surprise you in the city when your day is goin' shitty
Ain't gotta ask me to
What planet are you from, girl?
And are there others like you there?
And could you do that magic trick again?
Poppin' up from nowhere
Though my planet's full of warfare
You make it feel like a dream
Man I hope they never find you
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Hot sex and gold, shiny things
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Remind you that you are a lost queen
I think you are a lost queen
I don’t have a problem meeting mommy and daddy
Honey and sugar, man I bet they're so classy
Half of me is good, the other half nasty
Can't help it if I want it, want it
Sure I meet your friends on my best behavior
Talk about relationships, I used to be a player
And like GEICO, the time I saved 'em
And get their motors runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom
Lift your head when you're down so you don't drop your crown
Ain't gotta ask me to
And right before we finish, I'll ask you did you get it
Ain't gotta ask me to
What planet are you from, girl?
And are there others like you there?
And could you do that magic trick again?
Poppin' up from nowhere
Though my planet's full of warfare
You make it feel like a dream
Man I hope they never find you
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Hot sex and gold, shiny things
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Remind you that you are a lost queen
I think you are a lost queen
