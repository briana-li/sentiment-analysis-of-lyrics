[Verse 1]
Do you wanna start a cult with me?
I’m not vibrating like I oughta be
I need a purpose, I can’t keep surfing
Through this existential misery
Now, we gonna need some real estate
But if I choose my words carefully
Think I could fool you that I’m the guru
Wait, how do you spell “epiphany”?

[Chorus]
Before the truth will set you free, it’ll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
‘Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Could I have your attention, please?
It’s time to tap into your tragedy
Think you could use a new abuser
Close your eyes and listen carefully
Imagine you’re stood on a beach
Water gently lapping at your feet
But now you sinking, what were you thinking?
That’s all the time we have this week

[Chorus]
Before the truth will set you free, it’ll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
‘Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra

[Bridge]
And I know this doesn’t make a lot of sense
But do you really wanna think all by yourself now?
All I’m asking for’s a little bit of faith
You know it’s easy to believe
And I know this doesn’t make a lot of sense
You know you gotta work the corners of your mind now
All I’m asking for’s a little bit of faith
You know it’s easy to, so easy to believe

[Chorus]
Before the truth will set you free, it’ll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you gonna lose the plot
Before the truth will set you free, it’ll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
‘Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra
Oh!



[Verse 1]
What doesn't kill you makes you wish you were dead
Got a hole in my soul growin’ deeper and deeper
And I can’t take
One more moment of this silence, the loneliness is hauntin’ me
And the weight of the world’s gettin’ harder to hold up

[Pre-Chorus]
It comes in waves, I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me
I’m not okay and it’s not alright
Won’t you drag the lake and bring me home again?

[Chorus]
Who will fix me now? Dive in when I’m down?
Save me from myself, don’t let me drown
Who will make me fight? Drag me out alive?
Save me from myself, don’t let me drown

[Verse 2]
What doesn’t destroy you leaves you broken instead
Got a hole in my soul growin’ deeper and deeper
And I can’t take
One more moment of this silence, the loneliness is hauntin’ me
And the weight of the world’s gettin’ harder to hold up

[Pre-Chorus]
It comes in waves, I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me
I’m not okay and it’s not alright
Won’t you drag the lake and bring me home again?

[Chorus]
Who will fix me now? Dive in when I’m down?
Save me from myself, don’t let me drown
Who will make me fight? Drag me out alive?
Save me from myself, don’t let me drown

[Bridge]
‘Cause you know that I can’t do this on my own
‘Cause you know that I can’t do this on my own
‘Cause you know that I can’t do this on my own
(‘Cause you know that I can’t do this on my–)

[Outro]
Who will fix me now? Who will fix me now?
Who will fix me now? Dive in when I’m down?
Save me from myself, don’t let me drown



[Refrain]
S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let’s hear it
S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let’s hear it
Let’s go

[Verse 1]
I’ve had enough
There’s a voice in my head
Says I’m better off dead
But if I sing along
A little fuckin’ louder
To a happy song
I’ll be alright

[Verse 2]
You want to give up
Gave it all that you’ve got
And it still doesn’t cut
But if you sing along
A little fuckin’ louder
To a happy song
You’ll be just fine, ‘cause–

[Chorus]
Every now and again we get that feelin’
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I’m goin’ ‘round in circles
I’m goin’ ‘round in circles

[Refrain]
S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let’s hear it
S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let’s hear it

[Verse 3]
We are possessed
We’re all fucked in the head
Alone and depressed
But if we sing along
A little fuckin’ louder
To a happy song
Maybe we’ll forget, ‘cause–

[Chorus]
Every now and again we get that feelin’
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I’m goin’ ‘round in circles
I’m goin’ ‘round in circles
Don’t wake us up, we’d rather just keep dreamin’
‘Cause the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I’m goin’ ‘round in circles
I’m goin’ ‘round in circles

[Verse 4]
The world has coalesced
Into one giant mess of hate and unrest
So, let’s all sing along
A little goddamn louder
To a happy song
And pretend it’s all okay
(Let’s go!)

[Breakdown]
So, let’s sing along
Let’s sing along
A little fucking louder!
A little fucking louder!
Well, don’t you feel so much better?

[Refrain]
S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let’s hear it (Well, that’s the spirit)
S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let’s hear it (Yeah, that’s the spirit)



[Verse 1]
My head is haunting me, and my heart feels like a ghost
I need to feel something, ‘cause I’m still so far from home
Cross your heart and hope to die
Promise me you’ll never leave my side
Show me what I can’t see when the spark in my eyes is gone
You got me on my knees, I’m your one-man cult
Cross my heart and hope to die
Promise you I’ll never leave your side

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause I’m telling you, you’re all I need
I promise you, you’re all I see
‘Cause I’m telling you, you’re all I need
I’ll never leave

[Chorus]
So, you can drag me through hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you, ‘cause I’m under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you, I will follow you

[Verse 2]
Come sink into me and let me breathe you in
I’ll be your gravity, you be my oxygen
So, dig two graves, ‘cause when you die
I swear I’ll be leaving by your side

[Chorus]
So, you can drag me through hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you, ‘cause I’m under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you
So, you can drag me through hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you, ‘cause I’m under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you, I will follow you
I will follow you, I will follow you

[Intrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
So, you can drag me through hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you, ‘cause I’m under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you, I will follow you



[Verse 1]
Remember the moment you left me alone and
Broke every promise you ever made
I was an ocean, lost in the open
Nothing could take the pain away

[Chorus]
So, you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne!

[Verse 2]
The sticks and the stones that you used to throw have
Built me an empire, so, don’t even try
To cry me a river, ‘cause I forgive you
You are the reason I still fight

[Chorus]
So, you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne!
So, you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my–throne

[Bridge]
I’ll leave you choking
On every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you’ve broken
And now you know
I’ll leave you choking
On every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you’ve broken
And now you know

[Chorus]
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne!
So, you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Cut off my wings and come lock me up
Just pull the plug, yeah, I’ve had enough
Tear me to pieces, sell me for parts
You’re all vampires, so here

[Refrain]
You can have my heart (my heart, heart)
You can have my heart (my heart, heart)
You can have my heart (my heart, heart)
You can have my heart (my heart, heart)
You can have my

[Verse 2]
The world’s a funeral, a room of ghosts
No hint of movement, no sign of pulse
Only an echo, just skin, and bone
They kicked the chair, but we, we helped tie the rope

[Refrain]
You can have my heart (my heart, heart)
You can have my heart (my heart, heart)
You can have my heart (my heart, heart)
You can have my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
So come rain on my parade ‘cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge ‘cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it’s too late, and it’s not worth saving
So come rain on my parade

[Chorus]
I think we’re doomed
I think we’re doomed
And now there’s no way back

[Verse 3]
You must have made some kind of mistake
I asked for death, but instead, I’m awake
The Devil told me, “no room for cheats”
I thought I’d sold my soul, but he kept the receipt

[Bridge]
So leave a light on, I’m coming home
It’s getting darker, but I’ll carry on
The sun don’t shine, but it never did
And when it rains, it fucking pours, but I think I like it
And you know that I’m in love with the mess, I think I like it

[Pre-Chorus]
So come rain on my parade ‘cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge ‘cause my head is in overdrive
I’m sorry, but it’s too late, and it’s not worth saving
So come rain on my parade

[Chorus]
I think we’re doomed
I think we’re doomed
And now there’s no way back
I think we’re doomed
I think we’re doomed
And now there’s no way back

[Pre-Chorus]
So come rain on my parade ‘cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge ‘cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it’s too late, and it’s not worth saving
So come rain on my parade

[Chorus]
I think we’re doomed
I think we’re doomed
And now there’s no way back

[Outro]



[Chorus]
I wouldn’t hold my breath if I was you
‘Cause I’ll forget, but I’ll never forgive you
Don’t you know, don’t you know?
True friends stab you in the front

[Verse 1]
It’s funny how things work out
Such a bitter irony
Like a kick right to the teeth
It fell apart right from the start
But I couldn’t even see
The forest for the trees

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m afraid you asked for this
You’ve got a lot of nerve, but not a lot of spine
You made your bed when you worried about mine
This ends now

[Chorus]
I wouldn’t hold my breath if I was you
‘Cause I’ll forget, but I’ll never forgive you
Don’t you know, don’t you know
True friends stab you in the front?
I wouldn’t hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there’s nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

[Verse 2]
It’s kind of sad, ‘cause what we had
Well, it could’ve been something
I guess it wasn’t meant to be
So how dare you
Try and steal my flame just ‘cause yours faded
Well, hate is gasoline
A fire fueling all my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m afraid you asked for this
You’ve got a lot of nerve, but not a lot of spine
You made your bed when you worried about mine
This ends now

[Chorus]
I wouldn’t hold my breath if I was you
‘Cause I’ll forget, but I’ll never forgive you
Don’t you know, don’t you know
True friends stab you in the front?
I wouldn’t hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there’s nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

[Bridge]
You can run, but you can’t hide
Time won’t help you, ‘cause karma has no deadline
You can run, but you can’t hide
Time won’t help you, ‘cause karma has no deadline

[Chorus]
I wouldn’t hold my breath if I was you
‘Cause I’ll forget, but I’ll never forgive you
Don’t you know, don’t you know
True friends stab you in the front?
I wouldn’t hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there’s nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

[Outro]
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front



[Verse 1]
Cut me open and tell me what’s inside
Diagnose me, ‘cause I can’t keep wonderin’ why
And no, it’s not a phase, ‘cause it happens all the time
Start over, check again, now, tell me what you find

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause I’m goin’ out of frequency
Can anyone respond?

[Chorus]
It’s like an avalanche, I feel myself go under
‘Cause the weight of it’s like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance, my heart has frozen over
An’ I feel like I am treadin’ on thin ice

[Verse 2]
Am I broken? What’s the chance I will survive?
Don’t sugarcoat me, ‘cause I feel like suicide
Just give it to me straight, ‘cause I’m runnin’ out of time
I need an antidote, now, what can you prescribe?

[Chorus]
It’s like an avalanche, I feel myself go under
‘Cause the weight of it’s like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance, my heart has frozen over
An’ I feel like I am treadin’ on thin ice
An’ I’m going under

[Post-Chorus]
I need a cure for me, ‘cause the square doesn’t fit the circle
Give me a remedy, ‘cause my head wasn’t wired for this world
I need a cure for me, ‘cause the square doesn’t fit the circle
Give me a remedy, ‘cause my head wasn’t wired for this world

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m goin’ out of frequency
Can anyone respond?
‘Cause I’m goin’ out of frequency
Can anyone respond?

[Chorus]
It’s like an avalanche, I feel myself go under
‘Cause the weight of it’s like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance, my heart has frozen over
An’ I feel like I am treadin’ on thin ice
An’ I’m going under

[Post-Chorus]
I need a cure for me, ‘cause a square doesn’t fit the circle
Give me a remedy, ‘cause my head wasn’t wired for this world
I need a cure for me, ‘cause a square doesn’t fit the circle
Give me a remedy, ‘cause when it hits, well, it hits like an avalanche



[Chorus]
Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel, can you feel my heart?
(Can you feel my heart?)

[Verse]
Can you help the hopeless?
Well, I'm begging on my knees
Can you save my bastard soul?
Will you wait for me?
I'm sorry, brothers, so sorry, lover
Forgive me, father, I love you, mother

[Chorus]
Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel my heart?
Can you feel my heart?
(Can you feel my heart?)
(Can you feel my heart?)

[Bridge]
I'm scared to get close, and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim
I'm scared to get close, and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim
I'm scared to get close, and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim

[Chorus]
(Can you feel my heart?)
Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel, can you feel my heart?



[Verse]
My secrets are burning a hole through my heart
And my bones catch a fever
When it cuts you up this deep
It's hard to find a way to breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe

[Chorus]
Time stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking

[Breakdown]
I'm at the edge of the world
Where do I go from here? Do I disappear?
Edge of the world
Should I sink or swim? Or simply disappear?

[Pre-Chorus]
Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe

[Chorus]
Time stood still the way it did before!
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking

[Breakdown]
Wake up!
Take my hand and
Give me a reason to start again
Wake up!
Pull me out and
Give me a reason to start again

[Bridge]
Time stands still (time stands still)
Time stands still (time stands still)

[Pre-Chorus]
Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe

[Chorus]
Time stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Time stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
